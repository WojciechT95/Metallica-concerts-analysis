## Insights and Conclusions
The New York Accidents Dashboard provides several key insights:

- The highest number of collisions occurred during the winter between January to March. This is probably due to the slippery road surface at this time of year.
- The day when there are the most collisions is Friday, while the safest on the roads is on Sunday.
- Most collisions occur in the afternoon between 12.P.M. and 6.P.M. This is also when there is the most traffic when returning from school and work. The safest New York streets are at night, when there is the least traffic.
- The most colissions happen in the borough of Brooklyn and the most common reason for an accident is driver inattention or distraction.
