The project focuses on tracking the development of the team during all its activity.

## Technologies Used

**Microsoft Excel** used for
- Data Cleaning: containing operations such as: delete duplicates, dividing the collision date of the accident into day of the week, month and hour through the TEXT function, counting the number of lethal and injuries accidents through the IF function, narrowing the hours of the accident to four times of the day through the VLOOKUP function.
- Data Analyst : asking the data the relevant questions and creating pivot tables that answer these questions.
- Data Visualisation: creation of pivot charts corresponding to pivot tables with slicers.
  
PS. Functions are written in Polish because of the software i have.

## Insights and Conclusions
The New York Accidents Dashboard provides several key insights:

- The highest number of collisions occurred during the winter between January to March. This is probably due to the slippery road surface at this time of year.
- The day when there are the most collisions is Friday, while the safest on the roads is on Sunday.
- Most collisions occur in the afternoon between 12.P.M. and 6.P.M. This is also when there is the most traffic when returning from school and work. The safest New York streets are at night, when there is the least traffic.
- The most colissions happen in the borough of Brooklyn and the most common reason for an accident is driver inattention or distraction.
